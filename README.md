## Welcome to My GitHub Repository! 🚀

### Hey there! I'm Kévin Combriat, a French generalist programmer with over 12 years of experience, in France, Canada, and Japan. 🌍

I have a strong passion for backend development, particularly enjoying working with Rust, Node.js, and Golang! Besides, I'm deeply involved in frontend development, where I specialize in React and Svelte to create sleek and intuitive interfaces. 💻

### What I'm Into Lately

Lately, I've been diving into the captivating realms of Big Data and Machine Learning. My current project involves exploring how to structure a Lakehouse in Rust using technologies like Parquet, Arrow, and Datafusion. It's an exciting journey of exploration and discovery! 📊

### Fun Facts

On the side, I'm an avid reader. Some of my favorite reads include "L'Œuvre au noir" by Marguerite Yourcenar, "L'homme surnuméraire" by Patrice Jean, and all the works of Jean-Philippe Jaworski. 📚

Moreover, I have a profound love for history in general! 📜

Exploring the evolution of games and the game industry is another of my passions. 🎮
